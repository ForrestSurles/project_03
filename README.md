# Smart Risk Movements

---

## Introduction:

### Project Description:

We will program our application from project 2 to automate a decision to move money between funds based on the desired risk to maintain tolerance while seeking the fund with optimal returns within the risk tolerance. The program will output a decision and a smart contract will use that decision to move money between accounts that represent the funds.

### Project Objective:

The concept of using smart contracts to maintain a desired risk profile is fascinating. This project could be developed further to become a much more complex and wholistic  application.

### Research Questions:

What is the best way to design an application to move money between funds based on a user's desired risk profile?

How will different accounts be used to represent funds and allow for efficient movement of money?

Datasets:

Datasets will include information on a portfolio of stocks and a market ETF. This will include risk and return data.
