# Project_03

# Smart Risk Movements

---

## Introduction:

### Project Description:

We will be creating an application to manage a client's investment between Ethereum and a fund represented by the S&P 500 ETF. This application will allow the user to see the risk of the options and the fees associated with a conversion, then to execute a transfer if desired. The application will then transfer the amount beteen the options as selected.

### Project Objective:

This application assists client portfolio management by calculating transaction fees associated with transferring between Ethereum and a fund before enabling the client to initiate the transfer. The application then automates the transfer of the amount between Etherum and a fund.

### User Stories:

As a client, I want to know the fees associated with a transfer of my money between different assets before I initiate the transfer.

As a financial manager, I want to save time and money by automating the transfer of my client's assets so an employee can utilize their time more effectively.

### Datasets:

Datasets will include information on Ethereum and the VOO S&P 500 ETF.
